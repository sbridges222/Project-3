Algorithmic bias in machine learning models stems from the lack of diversity in training data and the failure to address existing biases within datasets. This can cause the algorithms to perpetuate societal biases and yield discriminatory results, especially concerning when applied to critical domains like hiring, lending, criminal justice, and healthcare. 
“Unmasking AI” by Joy Buolamwini is focused on the disparity in AI facial recognition technology’s accuracy across racial groups, and how the underrepresentation of diverse racial groups in datasets is connected to lack of diversity of the developer population in Silicon Valley. Facial recognition algorithms have been predominantly trained on the faces of white individuals, and as a result, do not consistently recognize the faces of other races and ethnicities.
